# Francesca Kubica’s Personal Portfolio 🎀

This is my personal portfolio website — Hello Kitty–themed and proudly pink — built to showcase my academic, professional, and creative work. I created it to have fun learning React and express myself through design while gaining experience in front-end development.

### ✨ About This Project

This site is built entirely from scratch using:

- ⚛️ React (first time using it!)
- 🎀 CSS and custom animations
- 💅 React-Bootstrap for responsive layout
- 💃 Animate.css for transitions and effects

Despite starting with no prior experience in React, JavaScript, or CSS frameworks, I built the entire portfolio in just **5 hours**. It was a playful challenge and a great way to learn by doing.

### 🧠 Features

- A clean, scrollable landing page with dynamic banners and gradients  
- Resume-style **Experience** section with animated company cards  
- Projects organized by **Class**, **Work**, and **Future Ideas**
- Fun SVGs, custom icons, and of course — lots of Hello Kitty 💖  
- Fully deployed with GitHub Pages
